## Building And Running
open the terminal:
```bash
cd talk
./scripts.sh setup
```

## Switching to develop mode
Talk uses Chat SDK and Chat SDK is a modular SDK, to put submodules in development mode run:
```bash
cd talk
./scripts.sh pkg local
```

to get back into the remote mode run:
```bash
cd talk
./scripts.sh pkg remote
```

The best way to work with this script is that you add it as a source to your bash file:
```bash
source path_to/scripts.sh
```

## Registerarion
&ast; Phone number registeration is required for running the app.
